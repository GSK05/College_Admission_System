# Blockchain-Based College Admission Transparency System  
Polygon PoS • Smart Contracts • IPFS • Full-Stack dApp

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a decentralized and tamper-proof college admission & waitlist management system using **Polygon Proof-of-Stake**, **Solidity smart contracts**, and **IPFS**.  
The system eliminates manual manipulation, improves transparency, and provides real-time status tracking for students while ensuring verifiable, immutable records for administrators.

---

## 🎯 Key Highlights
- Developed a full-stack blockchain application integrating smart contracts, decentralized storage, and a modern web frontend.  
- Designed an end-to-end transparent admission workflow deployed on **Polygon PoS (Amoy Testnet)**.  
- Leveraged **IPFS (Pinata)** for secure document storage while keeping blockchain storage efficient.  
- Integrated **MetaMask** for secure authentication and transaction signing.  
- Achieved low-cost, high-speed execution using Polygon’s PoS + BFT consensus.

## 💡 Features
- Students can submit applications, upload documents, and view real-time waitlist status.  
- Administrators can register colleges, verify applicants, and update admission status.  
- Smart contracts enforce:
  - Immutable, tamper-proof storage  
  - Automated input validation  
  - Transparent event logs  
- IPFS ensures document integrity while reducing blockchain storage costs.
